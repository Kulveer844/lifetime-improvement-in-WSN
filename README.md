# lifetime-improvement-in-WSN
This project explores a novel energy-efficient clustering strategy for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) aimed at significantly improving network lifetime, reliability, and data throughput. The proposed method uses dynamic, multi-criteria cluster head (CH) selection based on residual energy, node density, and distance to the base station.

The research leverages adaptive protocols (such as LEACH) and optimization techniques to balance energy consumption across sensor nodes and reduce premature node failure. The result is a highly scalable, efficient, and context-aware clustering approach suited for real-world applications like smart cities, environmental monitoring, and industrial automation.
